<title>sample article</title>
<a href = "sample_contents.html">sample contents</a><!--you MUST include link to previous contents file-->
<body>
    <h1>sample title</h1><!-- title to tell people whats in the article-->
    <hr><!--IMPORTANT!!!! how to use hr? you need to use hr before every sub title to separate text parts-->
    <h2>sub title</h2><!-- smaller title to identify subtitles
    it's recommended you make as many of them as you can for clearer organisation of text-->
    <div>blah blah blah 
        blah blah <a href = ""></a> <!-- thats how you add links for more info see sample_contents.html-->
